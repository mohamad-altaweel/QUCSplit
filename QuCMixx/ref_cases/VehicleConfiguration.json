    "description":"Optimization of pre-production vehicle configurations is one of the challenges in the automotive industry. for a list of tests requiring cars with certain features, we need to find the minimum number of cars that cover the tests and obey the configuration rules
this belongs to the class of SAT problems . The problem was formulated a QUBO problem and solved using Quantum Annealing.
With increasing instance complexity, the classical solver time-to-solve increases exponentially,
while the scaling appears to be subexponential for annealing approaches and overcome classical more than 90 variables. 
However, the classical outperforms quantum annealing methods regarding the ratio of valid solutions and the quality of returned solutions.",
    "result":"classic for less than 90 features"
