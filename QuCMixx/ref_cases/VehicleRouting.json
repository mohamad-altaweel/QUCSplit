    "description":"The Vehicle routing problem is a generalized formulation of TSP. We consider a set of vehicles which must visit a group of cities each once with the lowest possible cost. Each vehicle might have different travelling costs. This problem is extended with further constraints
The TSP class of this problem is mapped to a QUBO formulation. Using QAOA, The results shows that classical solvers can still produce better results than quantum method.",
